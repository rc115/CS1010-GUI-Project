Feel free to add anything

1. What is your project about - Game, application, etc.

Our project is a game that depicts the game of Black Jack. Allowing you to set certain amounts of "money" to bet and play the game. 

 

2. Who can play your game or use your application.

Casual or beginner players of black jack can play our game as it can be a good start to learn, with more lenient rules.

 

3. How will your game be played?

You will first put in how much "money" you will play with and your initial bet for the game. Then you will play your game of black jack by trying to get closer to 21 than the dealer. After it will be determined if you won or loss and give you money depending on the outcome.

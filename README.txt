Q: How will your game be played? 
A: Steps to step on how to play:

   1. After running the program it will start in the menu screen, here you can enter as many simoleons you want to play with but there is a minumum of 10 and a maximum of 1m

   1. You will first put in how many chips you will play with (minimum of 10), in the game then confirm it with the enter button and press the start button to get to the next window.

   2.  Next you will enter in the box below how many chips you will play with. A minimum of 10 chips is needed to play.

   3. Press the "Enter Bet" button and then press the "Hit" button to start your game.

   4. You will be given your hand and the dealer will get their hand, you will press the hit or stand button to get closer to 21 than the dealer. (the hit button will give you another card) (the stand button will keep your     current cards)

   5. Win conditions:
        If the player stands with 21, they win.                                        (Doubles bet)
        If the player exceeds 21, they lose and the dealer wins                        (Loses Bet)
        If you stand and you are closer to 21 than the dealer you win                  (Doubles bet)
        If you stand and the dealer is closer to 21 than you then the dealer wins      (Loses bet)
        If you and the dealer have same valued totals, then it's a tie                 (You get back the same ammount that you bet)

   6. After a winner and loser are decided chips will be given accordingly: Win: Gives you double your bet Lose: You lose what you bet Tie: You lose nothing

   7. Then you can press the reset button to play again and repeat through steps 2-6 until you fall below 10 chips which signifies a loss or you exceed 1 million chips.

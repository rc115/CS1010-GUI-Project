What is your project about - Game, application, etc. Our project is a game that depicts the game of Black Jack. Allowing you to set certain amounts of to chips to bet with and play the game. You're game will end once you ran out of chips, but it will continue as long as you have chips to play with.

Who can play your game or use your application. Casual or beginner players of black jack can play our game as it can be a good start to learn,with more lenient rules.



How will your game be played? Steps to step on how to play:

  1. You will first put in how many chips you will play with (minimum of 10), in the game then confirm it with the enter button and press the start button to get to the next window.

  2.  Next you will enter in the box below how many chips you will play with. A minimum of 10 chips is needed to play.

  3. Press the "Enter Bet" button and then press the "Hit" button to start your game.

  4. You will be given your hand and the dealer will get their hand, you will press the hit or stand button to get closer to 21 than the dealer. (the hit button will give you another card) (the stand button will keep your current cards)

  5. Win conditions: If either player exceeds 21, they lose and the other player wins If you stand and you are closer to 21 than the dealer you win If you stand and the dealer is closer to 21 than you then the dealer wins If you and the dealer have same valued totals, then it's a tie

  6. After a winner and loser are decided chips will be given accordingly: Win: Gives you double your bet Lose: You lose what you bet Tie: You lose nothing

  7. Then you can press the reset button to play again and repeat through steps 2-6 until you fall below 10 chips which signifies a loss or you exceed 1 million chips.

Q: What is your project about? - Game, application, etc? 
A: Our project is a game that depicts the game of Black Jack. 
   Allowing you to set certain amounts of to chips to bet with and play the game. 
   You're game will end once you ran out of chips, but it will continue as long as you have chips to play with.


Q: Who can play your game or use your application?
A: Casual or beginner players of black jack can play our game as it can be a good start to learn,with more lenient rules.


Q: How will your game be played? 
A: Steps to step on how to play:

   1. After running the program it will start in the menu screen, 
      here you can enter as many simoleons you want to play with,
      there is a minumum of ยง10 and a maximum of ยง1m,
      after you've entered a valid ammount the start button will activate which will start the game.

   2. The hit and stand buttons will be disabled until a valid bet is entered,
      then pressing hit will take the entered bet from your 'chips'.

   3. Pressing hit once will give you and the dealer 2 cards,
      after this the stand button will activate and pressing it will end the round.

   4. Win conditions:
        If the player stands with 21, they win.
        If the player exceeds 21, they lose and the dealer wins
        If you stand and you are closer to 21 than the dealer you win
        If you stand and the dealer is closer to 21 than you then the dealer wins
        If you and the dealer have same valued totals, then it's a tie
        If either the player or dealer gets blackjack the round ends

   5. After you win or lose your bet will be decided;
        Winning with blackjack triples your bet
        Winning by beating the dealer doubles your bet
        Tieing with the dealer gives back your bet
        Losing will not return your bet

   6. After the round is over you can restart if you enter a new bet,
      if you have less than the minimum bet you will be booted to the menu screen,
      here you can enter a new balance to your chips to play again.

   7. If at any point you have more than ยง1,000,000.00, you will be escorted off the premises. Says it in the name.
